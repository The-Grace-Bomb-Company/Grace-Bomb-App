This document explains how to use the app-settings template files.

To configure your application settings, you need to copy and paste the required data into the `app-settings.json` file.

Depending on your environment, you can choose between production values or debugging values.

For production values:

1. Open the `app-settings-production.json` file.
2. Copy the content.
3. Paste it into your `app-settings.json` file.

For debugging values:

1. Open the `app-settings-debug.json` file.
2. Copy the content.
3. Paste it into your `app-settings.json` file.

For specific Android debugging values:

1. Open the `app-settings-android-debug.json` file.
2. Copy the content.
3. Paste it into your `app-settings.json` file.

**Make sure to save the `app-settings.json` file after pasting the content.**
