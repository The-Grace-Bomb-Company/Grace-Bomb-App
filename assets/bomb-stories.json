    "Story": "I was in line for gas at Costco and it was the day before Christmas Eve. The line was long, and I was glad for it to finally be my turn to pump gas before going in the busy store to get a few last minute needs. As I was waiting for my tank to finish filling up, I noticed the guy next to me. At first I thought his membership card wasn't working, so I peeked around and offered my membership card for him to use. You have to have a membership card to be able to pump gas at Costco. After I realized it wasn't the membership card, but his debit or credit card, I offered to buy the his gas. His wife refused, but I insisted. I was so happy to pay for their gas, and after paying, I handed her a grace bomb card. It was such an easy thing for me to do, but I hope they were blessed. Merry Christmas!"

    "Story": "Like everyone else, I needed to create a new home office.  Once I bought a new suitable desk, I decided to sell my small, but nice, writing desk on FB marketplace. Well, I guess my ask price of $35 was low because within 10 minutes I had 13 inquiries.  So, in the interest of fairness I replied to the first ask. She promptly replied with \"great, we're coming. Will you take $20?\" Incensed by her low ball offer when obviously so many were interested in my incredible desk, I replied with \"absolutely not! I just listed it and there are plenty of of others who want it as well.  Full price.\" She went on to say that her husband was already on his way, would I please give it to him for $25. She had lost her job in March due to Covid and their daughter needed a place to do her virtual schooling.  I replied that I'm sorry her husband had already left but she better text him and tell him it would be $35 when he got here. Then...the Holy Spirit (through my husband :)) Was $35 going to make ANY difference in our lives? Now I was just being greedy and stubborn. What was I even thinking I thought to myself?? I texted the woman back, told her to text her soon-to-arrive husband and tell him it would be free.  I told her we were throwing in a chair as well and to please look in the drawer when her husband brought in the desk got home to find a Grace Bomb card. She replied she didn't know what to say.  I told her no need, I was being greedy, but in return please promise to go to the website listed on the card.  She texted about an hour later that she had indeed visited the website and felt blessed.  I now pray for that family, whoever they are, that they discover Jesus even through my initial greediness and selfishness! (PS when scrambling to find a GB card in all our usual places, my husband and I could only find one last beat up card - phew! Time to order some new cards!)"

Their shopping cart was full of groceries and it looked like it was all necessities. After the cashier rang everything up the husband tried a debit card but did not work. He then tried several more times and even a couple of other cards, but none worked. I heard a voice that told me to help. At that same moment my wife looked at me and I nodded my head. She stepped up to the card reader snd the couple stood by their cart and put our card in and paid for everything. The couple, and cashier, were in shock. The husband gave my wife and huge hug and thank you  and shook my hand. He and his wife walked away and stopped so she could sit. She then came back and hugged me and thanked my wife. The cashier was crying and said that we were her last customers. She thanked us for restoring her faith in humanity and Christmas. We haven‚Äôt told anyone this story as it was a very personal experience for all of us."

    "Story": "My Gramps passed away this week. He would of been 90 next month, and although unexpected, we knew it would happen some day. In a time where we are being trained to protect our elderly by keeping distance its hard to imagine losing someone you love, just because it was their time. But it was. \n\nAs my family starts working on finalizing his life, it was brought to my attention that he did not want a service or funeral. He simply wanted a big party full of his loved ones and family. Primarily his grandchildren and great grands, his little people. Gramps had money put aside, to make sure we would do this big party and spend time together, no excuses. As I processed through the idea of Gramps being gone and start planning the next steps, God whispered to my soul, \"You have been grace bombed\". There was no Grace Bomb card, but ultimately Gramps did Grace Bomb us by footing the bill and making sure we all would attend. To look at the whole week through God's grace and love has a made a difference and turned a sad time into a blessing. Thank you."

    "Story": "It's been hard to find places to work outside of the house during the pandemic, but yesterday I was out at a restaurant and coffee shop that had limited seating. The only table open was directly across from a young guy who was seated at a table looking super bummed out. Honestly, I couldn't tell if he just had a break up, or was fighting off a hangover. Whatever it was, from the look on his face, I could tell he was lacking peace.  I tried to ignore him, but I felt like the right thing to do in that moment was to go ask him if everything was OK. But this was awkward coming from a stranger in a mask. I was anxious about it, so I prayed briefly for courage. With sweaty palms I walked over trying not to act like a creeper, to ask if everything was alright. In muted fashion, he told me it was. No fireworks, no hallmark moment, but I had peace about making the ask, then got back to work. When I left, I grabbed a gift card from the shop and dropped it on him as a grace bomb, and told him I hoped his day gets a little better and to hang in there. I'm sharing this because I feel like now, I need to keep praying for this guy. Perhaps by prayer, this guy would be curious about our interaction, and drawn to Jesus to find true peace to remedy whatever he was battling against. (Mer, if you use this for a story, just keep it anonymous ?) "

    "Story": "Like most days, I was going grocery shopping one afternoon with my daughter. As I drove to the store I saw a man who looked a little lost walking down the street, but kept driving to the store. I could feel the holy Spirit tugging on my heart that something wasn't right with that man and he needed help. Sometimes God has to be very direct with me about a need. I finished my shopping, got my daughter into her car seat and put all the groceries in the backseat. All of a sudden as I'm about to start the car, the man knocked on my window. He said he needed a ride because his relatives had just left him in Greenwood. Now, I had cold things in the backseat and usually I wouldn't let a stranger into the car with my daughter there with me. I'm not going to lie I was a little hesitant at first, maybe even scared, but I let him into the car and I drove him to his destination. Now I drove for about an hour until we got to his house, and in that time we talked and shared some of our stories. He told me his name was Jacob and that he was working to get a job and get his life on track. He told me how grateful he was that I had driven him home. He even told my daughter that I was an angel. At his house I handed him the grace bomb and we said our goodbyes. I was sort of new to the whole grace bomb thing but I told him that I knew I was supposed to give him a ride. I prayed for him. Then I drove back home with my daughter and the groceries. My husband thought I was crazy for driving the guy anywhere, especially since I had our daughter with me. But I'm glad I listened to God and that He led me to meet a need that was right in front of me."

I've come to love sitting at the same table by the window, as it gets a lot of warm sunlight and is near an outlet. I'm almost always the only one there, except for one other guy who happens to be an early riser and have the same favorite table - the audacity! More than once, I found myself irritated at having to pick a different spot, as if I'm somehow entitled to that table. One morning as he left, I watched him walk beyond the parking lot across the shopping center, and I was humbled thinking that he was coming here on foot on cold winter mornings to enjoy breakfast in a warm seat by the window. Who was I to be so selfish and entitled over something as silly as a restaurant table? Feeling convicted, and reminded of how much Jesus loves him, the next time I saw him I purchased a gift card to the restaurant and gave it to him with a Grace Bomb card, telling him that God loves him. He was grateful, and thanked me twice. A few days later, I was happy to see him enjoying the sunny spot, and excited that we got to exchange smiles and hellos."

    "Story": "I was in the middle of a messy divorce, struggling to find a way to make ends meet. I had been a stay at home mom and was completely blindsided. I was threatened that I would be left with nothing, I would lose my kids, and that I would have to eat bugs to survive. One very specific threat my ex made was that since he had all the money he would be the one taking the kids to Disney and having such a wonderful life that they wouldn‚Äôt ever remember my name. Everyday was a struggle, especially since I saw no light at the end of the tunnel and every prayer seemed unanswered. \nEvery time I went to the grocery store I would hear a small voice say ‚Äúyou are going to buy someone‚Äôs grocery‚Äôs.‚Äù And I fought this voice because if I bought someone else‚Äôs groceries that meant I wouldnt have enough to buy my own.  But one day it finally happened, the Holy Sprit moved and I bought someone else‚Äôs groceries, and I heard the voice again, and again and I did it every time. I would Grace Bomb someone. It was scary because remember I was broke, BUT my bank account never over drew. It should have but it never did. \n\nHere is the BIG BOMB\n\nI took on a job  helping a family...the mother had MS so I was her aide and helped with things around the house. Still struggling, working 2 jobs...they asked if I would accompany them on their family vacation... yea you guessed it, to Disney. I said, ‚Äúwell thank you but I can‚Äôt go to Disney and not take my kids.‚Äù\nThey said, ‚Äúbring them!‚Äù \nAll expenses paid trip to Disney for me and my kids. \nThey Grace Bombed me!!\nAnd I know it was God that put it on their heart and orchestrated it all because only He knew about those threats from my ex. Only He knew the pain and the struggle. And He was listening to all my prayers. To this day I have not had to eat a bug, I have an amazing job, beautiful home, and my kids...my amazing kids, never forgot my name."

She was standing on the corner in front of the drug store - so I went over to her and put the poncho over her head. She did not move at all. But as I picked up her hand to give her some money and a Grace Bomb card - a small tear slid down her cheek as she smiled a toothless smile. She never spoke.

We would see the same cashier, who would answer \"wonderful\" when we would casually ask him how it's going. This made us smile, and my son Jack suggested that we Grace Bomb him. A year ago, we would have given him a surprising tip right then and there, but instead we decided to wait and pray first. So between the next couple of visits we asked his name, so we could be praying privately for him. Then one night he was outside with a friend who was skate boarding, and we found out that he was just getting into that sport. That's when we thought it would be cool to Grace Bomb him somehow incorporating that. So this past Wednesday afternoon we picked up a gift card to a local skate shop, and later that night were ready to drop our bomb. The cool part was that night at 7-11, he recognized us, and engaged us first - which led to a fun moment of explaining grace and hooking him up. Where things go from here, the Lord knows, but for sure we will keep him in prayer - and if you are reading this today, perhaps you would too?"

Last week, a dear friend in Christ reached out and asked how we had been doing, and in the process of the conversation, past due bills had been mentioned, with absolutely no underlying intent of asking for help, just merely a discussion.

Her family asked me to pick up a new pair. I could not find any locally and online was too expensive. I remembered my mother's red slipper booties I have kept since she passed for 12 years on the top shelf of my closet where I would always see them. They were Grace's size!!!

As I looked at her, I noticed she was shabbily dressed, and probably had been doing some outdoor work that day. I prayed quickly and asked God what amount of cash I should give her based on my wallet's contents- I asked God, \"Should I give her ______, ________, or ______?\" God impressed on me the highest of the 3 numbers to give, LOL, and so I moved over behind her, and tapped her on the shoulder, and handed her the bill.\n\nShe was kind of stunned, but said \"Hello!...Um, why are you doing this?\" \n\nIt was off-brand for me not to use a version of a Grace-Bomb-response, but given the age of the woman, and the likelihood that she would never go to a website, I simply said, \"I'm a friend, and friends take care of each other, right?!?!?\"\n\nIt turns out as we talked that I knew the lady already, but didn't recognize her from behind, as both my wife and I had given her rides at different times in the past to different locations on island. \n\nShe is a widow, with a love for music and helping other people. She can often be found playing her ukulele and singing for people in various locations on island, and so I was SO glad that our \"random errands\" allowed us to be blessing to someone who so often is a giant blessing to many others.\n\nAs is regularly the situation, our opportunities to bless others, powered by Grace, seem to flip right around and become an immediate blessing to ourselves. \n\nSo glad to be connected to a group that is focused on blessing others out of the overflow of Grace given to us by our Lord Jesus."

    "Story": "On Saturday I was out of town for a funeral and decided to stop at a Waffle House. It was lunch time and they were slammed, so I waited a few minutes for a seat. The young woman who waited on me was about my age, and I could tell she was busting her backside to keep up with the crowd. As I waited for my food - and All Star, because if you only go to Waffle House once every three years, you have to go all out - a little boy of about 3 years old puked on the floor next to my table. My appetite subdued, I watched as the staff kept serving orders and one called for a mop and bucket. A woman a few tables away who had already been loudly complaining about the pace of service waited all of two minutes before questioning my server about why she hadn't dropped everything she was doing to clean up the mess. The exchange between them got ugly fast, with the woman cursing and making cruel, condescending comments to my server as the volley between them escalated into a scene that held the attention of everyone in the restaurant. I was glad the woman stormed out mid-rant, because I had begun to think of ways to intervene to try to spare my server the berating. The remaining patrons looked at one another in disbelief as the floor was mopped. The tiles beside me still wet, I mustered up the gastrointestinal fortitude to quickly consume most of my meal and headed to the checkout counter. I paid my $9 tab, and gave my server $20 and a Grace Bomb card. I told her, \"You did not deserve to be spoken to that way, and I'm so sorry that happened.\" She thanked me with a smile. I hope it was a bright enough spot in her day to redeem the negativity she'd just experienced."

    "Story": "I applied to my new position here at Arrive Logistics, I was scared to move to Austin, I was unprepared ( financially and resource-wise), I had a low credit score, I didn't know where I was going to live or how I would even have a sitter for work. I believe and prayed to God, that if the position was for me, to please let his will be done.\n\nWhen applying for the position, it was listed as a temporary 4-month contract position for 20 an hour. I had 4 interviews with Arrive's employees,(the Office Manager, my future Manager and VP of IT, and my current teammates). After the interview, I got a call from HR stating that I would be accepted with Arrive to be hired! I accepted the position without a doubt!  Then a few weeks later, reality kicked in, I realized that I didn't have funds to move, nor a place to stay, gas money for work, not a sitter or Daycare in Austin. I then emailed the Arrive representatives and stated that I wasn't able to start, because of my fears of being homeless, and losing my son to the system. I explained this to Arrive hoping that they'd understand, why I can't work with them.\n\nWELL to my luck of God's blessings, I had no idea, that I applied to a company full of supporting, loving, and selfless beings. I get an email later from my manager and Director that they would support me in moving, by providing resources, My manager's wife went out of her way to open a Gofund me account, so that I could have a deposit for moving into my apartment, she provided me resources for locating apartments, and help with my first rent and childcare. She also helped me with clothes and furniture for my children when moving into my first home. My director gifted me money to help with food and gas for driving down to Austin, my VP also assisted me with mental support for being a mother and provided resources and support in motherhood. I don't believe things happen out of pure coincidence or luck, because of this, I was even more inspired to try harder and work hard knowing that I was supported, from my school, and now my future career. 3 weeks after starting work with Arrive, I was transitioned to full-time, I was no longer a contract worker, and my Director raised my pay to 23 an hour. (which just changed my life).\n\nI had no idea, that when applying to Perscholas while at the lowest point in my life, would help me to believe in myself and start the success journey to where I am now and the wonderful people I work with. I would really love to highlight the wonderful people in my story because it has made an additional impact on my life and further continue success and support, and these were just the small details of it!\n\nSince being hired, I have been asked to join Arrives company of Customer service committee, Even though I am on the IT tea, I have been recognized by the company for showing great customer service. That warms my heart, I plan on making a huge impact on the world one day, and if I can start making an impact now in the workplace, I can most definitely do the same on a bigger scale in the real world for other people who were like me"

    "Story": "If I never believed in fairy Grandmothers before, I do now.  There is nothing in this world that could have prepared me for what it is like to have a deployed spouse.  The only way I could have truly understood it was to have gone through the experience myself.  I have been told ‚Äúwell you signed up for this‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt wil go so fast‚Äù, ‚Äúyou knew what you were getting yourself into‚Äù.  Leaving me to believe I had absolutely no support system because the one person I depend on as my partner and my best friend was called away to serve our country.  An honor, a challenge, and a gift we both consider to be sacred.  My children and I found ourselves at our local Mexican restaurant celebrating my daughters birthday.  Her birthday fell on Monday so we were actually at the restaurant on the day of my deployed husbands birthday.  It was a nice outing with my parents however it would have been a thousand times better of course had we had my husband there to celebrate with.  We met Teresa (I think that was her name) and instantly I felt so calm, no joke.  I felt as though my husband had sent her because he knew I just needed to be seen the way he sees me.  My kids loved her and they both got multiple hugs from her and it was like magic.  I remember thinking I wish she could come hang out with us sometime.  Then she came to our table and said how our bill was taken care of.  I had never had that experience in my life and I feel so grateful.  If you are reading this your gift came at a superb time.  Meeting you was amazing and what you provided for us so generous and kind.  You lifted my spirits.  Deployment is a long haul, we are on month six and now since my husband got sent to Afghanistan somewhere with no contact and no idea when he will be coming home it just turned into an eternity.  Well at least that is how it feels to me.  Your kindness is appreciated so much, I don‚Äôt even think words can fully express my gratitude.  The timing of meeting you and finding out Daniel was leaving it made the night before that much sweeter.  Thank you from the bottoms of my heart.  You are a gracious and kind soul and I feel fortunate that our paths crossed.  Perhaps you could tell me what church you go to.  We truly are looking for a church that is good for kids and adults alike.  \nThank You"

School was in session but there were many children around who should have been in school.  We learned they were sent home from school because they did not have the school fees to continue.  Some for as little as $10.  One family owed about $30 in school fees for 3 young girls to return to school. We both knew immediately this was where the Grace Bomb was landing.\n\nWhat started as a simple nudge and obedience perfectly translated to meeting the basic needs of several children returning to school from a small village church in Africa. We pray this is just the beginning of our relationship to serve the children and families in this village.\n\nThere is a soul on the other side of our obedience.

    "Story": "I went to a local food bank this morning to get some food for my family. I love this place. The woman who runs it is so full of Jesus and the mission He has given her to feed His people. I hung out for a bit and during that time a young woman came in for food for her family. It was evident she was well known by the staff. They took real joy in helping her get the food she needed including a birthday cake for her daughter. I couldn't make myself walk away. Suddenly the grace bomb thought hit me. I had a little money on me. A delicious sense of joy hit me cause I knew I was going to grace bomb this woman with $20. I couldn't do it anonymously so I stepped up like a t.v. announcer and said, \"You've been grace bombed!\" in a loud announcer voice and handed her the money and the card. She jumped and said she couldn't take the money and I said, \"You can't give grace back! You know that!\" and walked off. I felt so awkward and did not plan the way I did it but I felt positively light hearted afterwards. I think I got the grace bomb boomerang. Thank you for this opportunity!"

As I left the store (unsuccessful in my search), I tripped and fell pretty hard on my ‚Äúgood knee.‚Äù The customer that I had just held the door for came out to make sure I was alright, and I assured him I was. I walked a bit more slowly (and slightly painfully) to my car. The manager of the store came out to find me, came to the car to be sure that I was REALLY okay-she was genuinely concerned. Again, I told her that I was and drove to the next thing I had to do. I wrote a thank you note to her, and my husband was actually able to hand deliver her the note with the Grace Bomb card inside. She told my husband that she had been worried about me and hoped that I really was alright-I pray that she knows that she does not go unnoticed, neither does her genuine care and concern for others."

    "Story": "After our morning service I went to a local diner for breakfast as I had some time before I needed to be back at church for a meeting.  I thought it would be a great opportunity to drop my first Grace Bomb by leaving a larger than normal tip for my waitress.  Almost immediately doubts and fear started to rise, but I determined that I was going to do it anyway.  As I sat waiting for my meal, watching and listening to what was happending around me, a family at the next table was trying to get a picture together and asked if I would take it for them.  I was glad to do it, and then went back to waiting for my meal to come.  Shortly after my food arrived, my waitress came back and told me that my meal had been paid for.  The family I taken the picture for had paid for my meal on their way out.  They may not have intended to drop a Grace Bomb on me, but it was an intentional act of kindness that I appreciated as a gift of grace from God.  However, it disrupted my plans to Grace Bomb my waitress.  I had planned to leave a tip with my payment for my meal on my debit card and had no cash with me.  I wasn't sure if the family had given a good tip for my waitress along with paying for my meal, so I decided that I could leave and go get cash as an ATM and come back with a tip and a Grace Bomb card.  I still wasn't sure whether I was actually going to do it, but I thanked my waitress for her service and asked her name so I could make sure she got it if I did come back.  Her name was Grace, and I did go to the ATM and back to the diner, leaving a tip with a Grace Bomb card and a note thanking her again for her service and telling her that if she had never heard of God's grace I hoped she would visit the website on the card."

Called my insurance agent and she had 7-1/2 inches of flooding in her finished basement. She was going down the stairs and fell, breaking her tailbone. I had to drop off paperwork, so I had baked chocolate chip cookies, put some in a bag, walked in and said, You have been grace bombed! Then I went to my dermologist and a Vietnam Vet was checking in at the other window. He only had one leg. The receptionist told him he owed $8.00 and some change and he said he would pay later. He left the window, I handed the girl a $10.00 and said I wanted to pay his bill.  I went over to where he was sitting, handed him a card and said, \"Sir, you have been Grace Bombed.\" He was very appreciative and I saw him looking both sides of the card over. I LOVE doing this. There are so many opportunities out there. Be open to possibilities."

As the man from the one family was watching the kids that he had with him pick out what they wanted, I walked up to him and handed him the Grace Bomb card.

I like the idea of paying for the person behind me in the drive-through line, since I stop by Dunkin Donuts every day before work as it gave me the opportunities.  It‚Äôs truly fun to surprise people, especially strangers, in this way.  I think it makes more of an impact because the recipient knows that it‚Äôs an act of kindness shown by someone who has no idea who they are.  And the cashier asked me ‚Äúwhy would you want to do this?‚Äù  So it‚Äôs great to be able to hand the GB card over, so that the word gets out to all involved in the act of kindness.  In the end, six of my seven GB‚Äôs were done at DD, and the last one was a little different.  That one, was a gift given to a woman I work out with at our gym.  I got her some new swag that came out, which she wanted.  So I bought it for her before it sold out as she was out of town.  She was really touched and posted an image of the gift on the gym‚Äôs FB page along with a note of gratitude.  In Acts 20:35 it references Jesus saying ‚ÄúIt is more blessed to give than to receive‚Äù, which teaches that there is joy in the act of giving when we do it with pure motives.  Ain‚Äôt that the truth!  Love the whole Grace Bomb movement and this month‚Äôs challenge was a true joy to carry out.   #kindnessmatters #intentionalacts"

She always has a smile and I know that showing that smile can be hard for her because of things that I have found out, through our conversations, that she is going through.  She is a single mom.  We were talking about a lot of different things but on this day one thing stood out to me.  She was talking about an incident that happened to her a few days prior and it involved having some food spilled on her clothes.  She was home on her lunch break when this happened and she couldn't change her clothes because she said she didn't have many.  So she had to go back to work with clothes that were stained and wet from the spill and it just made her feel a little embarrassed.  As soon as she told me this the thought of grace bombing her came to my mind right away.  However, over the next few days I had pushed the thought from my mind for one reason or another.  The Lord continued to bring her to mind and I could not push the thought away and longer and knew I had to do something.  I wrote her a thank you note for always being so kind when I am there and included some cash and a grace bomb card.  Today, I went over to the shop knowing that she was on her lunch break and placed it on her desk for her to see when she returned.  She contacted me a little while later and told me that this really really made her day and thanked me for my kind words and thoughtfulness.  I'm so glad I finally acted on the Holy Spirit's prompting.  Yes - it took out a few minutes of my already busy day but it was totally worth it."

    "Story": "On Saturday, I was sitting in my chair, browsing my phone.  It had been a long morning of running errands with my husband, and I was recovering from a broken leg, so, seemingly small activities were sapping my strength.  I was exhausted, a little cranky, and was in a bit of pain.\n\nMy husband came in and was surfing his computer for some needed farm supplies from a chair across the room.\n\nAs an aside, we live on a small farm that we just got two years ago.  My lifelong dream had always been to have a farm where I could rescue animals that people no longer wanted, and let kids who were lonely, bullied, special needs, etc, come and just brush the animals, befriend the animals, read to the animals‚Ä¶. I believe so strongly in the therapeutic bond they can have.  We now have rescued horses, donkeys, chickens, rabbits, dogs, cats, and an old raccoon that lives in the barn, and are working on getting our non profit status.\n\nOn this day, a notification in my email caught my eye for someone looking for puppies on the Nextdoor App.  Being the proud human ‚Äúmother‚Äù to a family of three three week old King Charles Cavalier Spaniels, I was looking for any way to get the word out, so I clicked on the posting.  Replied that I had puppies, but that it looked like they were looking for rescues, but if not, feel free to reach out.  Easy peasy.  \n\nI should say at this point that I almost NEVER go onto Nextdoor.  This was a fluke.  But on this day, I met God there.\n\nSoon (2 minutes?) after my posting, I got a private message from a woman named Kelly.  She said that she was looking for a puppy for her son.  He was supposed to get a puppy that day, but the seller backed out at the last minute.  Can you imagine a child‚Äôs excitement over getting a puppy on that day and having their hopes dashed?  But there is more to the story.  Her son is on the spectrum.  His extreme anxiety was making it impossible for him to go to school, to restaurants, to the store.  Three Doctors had recommended that he get a dog.  He was a 12 year old boy who weighed 277lbs.  \n\nShe asked me how much my puppies were.  I told her (over $1000), but I told her that I had a passion for working with special needs kids, so I would be willing to work with her on price and a payment plan.  She asked me what a payment plan would look like.  I asked her how much she had been planning to pay for her other puppy (I expected her to say $3-500).  She replied‚Ä¶$50.  Almost nothing.  \n\nI should stop and say a few things about my puppies.  First, they are highly desirable, and I was already selling these at a ‚Äúpet quality‚Äù price.  These dogs go for over $3000 typically.  Secondly, I do this to help pay for farm expenses because we are not rolling in the dough.  Third, there were only three puppies in this litter.  Fourth, and maybe most important, these dogs would be fantastic companion dogs!  They love everyone!  They love to be with their people!  They sleep in your lap, and generally make you feel like the most wonderful person in the world.  These dogs would be great for this kid.\n\nAs I looked at my screen, an overwhelming feeling came over me.  I turned to my husband.  I had been typing in silence up until that point.  I told my husband the story.  Then I said to him:  ‚ÄúI want to do something crazy‚Äù. And I started sobbing.  ‚ÄúI want to give them a puppy‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have waited my whole life for this‚Äù.  Ron, also through tears said ‚Äúgive them a puppy‚Äù.  We didn‚Äôt have to pray to ask Jesus what to do.  Jesus had already given us the overwhelming knowledge of what He wanted us to do.\n\nI asked Kelly if I could call her, and told her, through tears, that I wanted to give her son, Elias, a puppy.  That evening, I fulfilled the next part of the way that I felt God was leading me.  Rather than giving Elias whatever puppy was left, after I sold the others, I had a FaceTime call with him and let him pick his puppy.   He named her Bella because she was so beautiful. üß°\n\nSince the puppies will not be old enough to leave until mid December, I am sending Elias and his Mom notes and pictures daily.  I mention Jesus frequently.  He says I‚Äôm his best adult friend.  \n\nI have also decided that I will continue to donate a puppy out of every litter to a special needs kid. \n\nI am so filled with joy.  God still fulfills your dreams later in life."

I went to Walmart, and was at the self checkout. I saw a guy behind me in Walmart uniform, and immediately knew that was going to be my first grace bomb. I asked if I could pay for his items, and did, and gave him a grace bomb card. If it weren't for the card, I wouldn't have been praying for God to find me someone to bless, and wouldn't have done anything. I know that working for a store can be very stressul, especially when it comes to customers, so I pray that God give that man the strength he needs. I see God working in my life, and it's amazing to be able to do so for someone else. One card down, 14 more to go! :)"

When we got to Outback we happen to notice that there was a gentleman sitting by himself and he had shown his military ID for the veteran's discount. The Holy Spirit just kept nudging me that we should pay for his meal and give him a grace bomb card. We asked him what branch of military he was in and he said Army. We thanked him for his service. I was able to share with my son that Veteran's Day is when we appreciate the people that served in our country. We paid for his meal and handed him a Grace bomb card. When he was leaving he came over to our table and thanked us so much and said \"no one had ever done that for him and it was such a blessing\". I know people say it all the time but this truly was a blessing for me and my son. It was nice to be able to show God's love to a veteran on this special day!"

Of course we could not say thank you , we were told they left. All I could say was thank you God .\n  This is such a wow factor and I am still taken back .

    "Story": "I apologize for the wordiness of this post, but it seems a Christmas story too sweet to not tell.\n\nRecently, I learned that friends had lost most of their Christmas ornaments due to flooding in their basement. These were ornaments collected over a period of years, and that carry sweet memories.  A group at church decided to gift the friend with new ornaments, knowing that the new ones could not replace the old, but, perhaps, could bring about other fond memories.\n\nWhile at Katy's Hallmark looking for an ornament for my friends, a sweet woman asked if she could help me.  I told her I was just looking for an ornament for friends who had lost theirs.  She explained that she is in a Hallmark ornament collectors' group, and she took my name and number, explaining that her group was having their annual Christmas party the coming weekend.  She thought, perhaps, they might have some ornaments they would like to donate.  She even called me later to get information about the interests and ages of children in the family so she could gather appropriate ornaments.  When she called to say that she had gathered some ornaments, my husband drove to her home to get them.  It was not a few ornaments; it was three or four big bags full, as well as a large Advent calendar.  It was a bounty of ornaments.  \n\nThat night was the gathering where we \"showered\" our friend with the ornaments we had bought and the ones that Martha, from Katy's Hallmark, had sent.  There were even ornaments included from the years of the births of my friends' children.  Some were taken by others at the party to tuck into gifts for the Mending Hearts Christmas party, an organization that encourages and helps women who are in recovery.  \n\nThe next day on FB, I saw where a friend had a small tree with no ornaments. I suspect if she had money to spend on ornaments, she would spend it on the homeless instead.  A group of a few ornaments had been left behind at my house, so I figured this would be the perfect place for them to go live.  In addition to which, they are miniature ornaments which will be lovely on this friend's small tree.  \n\nThe next day, a friend posted on FB that someone she knows lost their Christmas tree and asked if anybody have one to donate.  Someone did.  In the meantime, the friend for whom this all started, texted and said she was going to bring back some of the ornaments she could not use and for me to give them to anyone who could use them.  I communicated with the friend whose friend had lost his tree (someone stole it and his ornaments out of his shed...can you say Grinch?, bless their hearts)) and asked if he needed ornaments.  Turns out they had been stolen also.  So, today, I deliver ornaments.  So many people blessed by one generous and kind woman, working in a store, who took the time to listen to a gabby customer.  One person's actions blessing so many people.  It is a Christmas story I won't soon forget."

As we  arrived to the window to pay for our order, we could hear the cashier speaking through her headset to the vehicle behind us - then she gasped and cursed. Of course, we were a bit surprised and taken back, however, this incident gave us more fuel to spread God‚Äôs grace. The cashier open the drive thru window with force and out put her hand out for our payment   I said hello and handed her my card. She swiftly closed the window and went back to the car behind us abruptly asking what they wanted to order. Mind you, the time was 10:25 am and both the car behind us are we are ordering breakfast. Breakfast at this restaurant ends at 10:30 am. When the cashier opened the window to give me my receipt, I said, ‚Äú I would like to pay for the car behind us.‚Äù She then asked, with an abrupt attitude, ‚ÄúDo you know him?‚Äù, to which I replied, ‚Äú No, not at all.‚Äù  Surprisingly, she responded, ‚Äú You‚Äôre not paying for him, he just yelled at me!‚Äù  I said, ‚ÄúYes, I am paying for him and I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.‚Äù She told me the amount for his order and I handed her a Grace Bomb card to give to the car.  She asked why I wanted to do so, and was very intrigued. I said, ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a nice thing to do and you can look at the card, go to the website and learn about what God does as well.‚Äù She looked stunned and was quiet. She ended our encounter with, ‚ÄúOkay,  thank you and have a nice day.‚ÄùThough the amount of the car receipt behind us was only $1.06, it wasn‚Äôt about the money or about the deed. The grace comes from God and it‚Äôs up to us to listen and respond.  I believe, that Grace Bomb was really meant for the cashier and I‚Äôm so thankful I responded to God‚Äôs guidance"

I gave him the money and as he started to walk away after thanking me, I gave him the grace bomb card.  He was curious and seemed intrigued.  Later that day I began thinking \"I may have planted a seed today\"  or maybe God touched more than one life since the man probably needed someone with the internet to look up the grace bomb website.  Maybe that person would also be interested.  I can't describe how happy I was to know God may have placed me there at that time to help this man out and to introduce him to God's love.  Although I'll probably never know how it turned out, it showed me that we never know when an opportunity will arise to show someone God's love in performing a random act of kindness."

She was in her 20s and not only did a very good job in attending to our needs, but she had a very sincere way about her that would lead one to feel as though she really did care. So after dinner was complete, we were at the cash register settling up and she was the one ringing up our total. I paid with a debit card and I signed the receipt and told her that she would notice that there was no tip on the receipt. I am sure she was thinking that she wasn't going to get a tip, but then I told her it was because her tip was right here as I handed her a $50 bill with a Grace Bomb card. It was my first time using the card and I am sure she wasn't sure what had just happened and with how busy the restaurant was there wasn't much of an opportunity to share, but I have learned that next time I will be more intentional about that. Either way it was a great way to start off what I plan to be the first of many, many Grace Bombs!!!"

She apologized again and I told her that I was truly in no rush. I was convicted, here I was standing in line with not one but two reusable bags. Why was I so afraid to give up what I had? I agonized in line and made excuses as to why I shouldn't offer to give her mine. \"My bags are too small to fit all their things\", \"I might offend them and I'll be rejected anyway\", \"I forgot my Grace Bomb cards in the car!\". The teller could only offer them bags that had slight tears in them but they made due. Before I got the courage to offer anyway, they were done and it was my turn at the register. I missed my chance. The teller scanned my things and I paid but the mother and daughter were still near the register getting their things and the teller was talking to another co-worker. This was my chance! I'm going to offer my bag. I was getting ready to find the words when the teller handed me my change and I walked right past the mother and daughter. I missed my second chance. I was so nervous and scared, my heartbeat was in my head and my cheeks were really hot. I felt so ashamed. God had prompted me to reach out to this family and I missed two chances. As I walked back to my car, I couldn't believe myself, I had just said earlier that day: \"Gosh I have too many grocery bags.\" God was answering a prayer and I was too afraid to follow. I opened my car door and dropped off my things. As I turned to get into the driver's side, I noticed the mother and daughter waiting outside the store. This was my final chance! I scrambled to grab a larger grocery bag from my trunk and a Grace Bomb card from my center console. I rushed towards them even waving my hand in the air to get their attention. I couldn't miss them a third time. At first, they looked away, confused even. Once I got close enough I handed them the bag and told them to visit the website on the card. The daughter asked if she could give me a hug and the mother thanked me several times. It all happened so fast. I finally did what God had called me to do: bless someone. Thank you God for giving me another chance."

I was blessed to be able to go out to lunch with him and really get to know him. After much discussion I asked him if he would like me to try to get him a job at my work and he said yes. So I gave him the information and very hopeful that he will get this job to get him from sleeping on the streets. \nI am blown away but what God is doing and he said he was going to continue coming to church.

I was like ‚ÄúThank you so much! What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù and he goes like ‚ÄúPat‚Äù. I‚Äôd heard of Pastor Pat who used to work at the church before I joined and I asked him ‚ÄúPat Linnell?‚Äù ‚ÄúLike Grace Bomb writer Pat?‚Äù and he was like look at the card! I look at the card and it said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been grace bombed!‚Äù I was so encouraged and reoriented my thoughts to scripture and as he was leaving I was reminded of Hebrews 12:1-2 ‚Äú ‚ÄúTherefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.‚Äù Just want to encourage everyone as I was encouraged. God is working in ways that we don‚Äôt see. We maybe just a speck in this infinite beautiful universe, but I know from these grace filled moments that He is thinking of me."

    "Story": "Last weekend I was visiting family at the beach, and decided to try two different diners Saturday and Sunday morning to see who had the better breakfast in town. At the first one, I sat unnoticed for at least 10 minutes before a waiter trotted over and apologized profusely for not knowing I was one of his tables. I ordered a pancake breakfast, and my flustered waiter apologized and checked in on me at least five more times. I left him a $20 Grace Bomb tip on my $8 meal and left him a note not to sweat the small stuff. The next morning, I tried another diner and ordered the same pancake breakfast for a fair comparison. My waitress was wearing a \"birthday girl\" sash, and I overheard her tell another customer that she turned 21 that day. Special day! As she rang me up, I wished her a happy birthday and added a $50 tip to my bill as a gift. She was so surprised and grateful! Neither diner was fantastic, but both afforded me opportunities to bless someone and point them to Jesus. And for those who want to know, diner #2 had the better short stack."

It is my favorite food group. \n\nAnyway, we got there and the Lord blessed us in that we didn‚Äôt have to wait. We walked in and got a table right away. We sat down and a young man came over to wait on us. He was very attentive and was working hard to make sure that we were taken care of. It was then that I felt the Spirit give me an elbow and point me to Grace Bomb our server. I suggested it to Jo and she gave me the thumbs-up seal of approval. \n\nSo when we were finished and had already paid the check and included the tip at the register‚Ä¶I called the server over, I explained that I am a pastor here in Pueblo West and explained that Jesus calls us to love our neighbors and that was what we were feeling led to do so I handed him the Grace Bomb card and some cash.\n\nHe stood there silent while I was explaining and then said, ‚ÄúNo way! Really?‚Äù I told him it was from God we were just delivering it. He thanked us several times and then said that he had to leave because if he didn‚Äôt he was going to start crying. Then he walked away and we gathered our things and left. I have no idea what the server‚Äôs needs are or how the Grace Bomb will effect him. That‚Äôs up to God. But who knows‚Ä¶it, that gift of grace, may just make all the difference in that young man‚Äôs life.\n\nAnd I can tell you that we all left the restaurant with smiles on our hearts."

    "Story": "The idea came to me while sitting in the Chick-fil-A drive-thru. I had just prayerfully asked, 'Lord, what should my next Grace Bomb be?' and immediately the answer came: Host an adult Easter egg hunt. Seems odd Lord, but okay - You're the boss. With Easter approaching in just 10 days, I hastily made invitations advertising an egg hunt for adults that would feature eggs filled with cash, gift cards, coffee beans, household items, and of course candy. I planned it for 8:30 p.m., after kiddos would be asleep, and told everyone to bring flashlights. I posted in our community Facebook page, left an invitation at all 182 front doors, and prayed people would come. Every day for the next week, as more people responded to the invitation, I bought more eggs and prizes. The day of the event, I recruited two friends to help me scatter the 1,100 eggs I had dutifully filled for the past week all over our community playground and field. Dusk faded to dark, and we waited to see who would come. The first participant showed up with a big smile and competitive spirit at 8:01p.m.! By 8:28 p.m., I was overjoyed that nearly 60 of my neighbors had come out for the hunt - some sporting glow sticks and bunny ears! I gave each person a bag that contained a Grace Bomb card, church invite, and glow bracelet. The clock struck 8:30 p.m., and five dozen grown adults took off running across the field, flashlights searching every nook of the playground and every bush on the property for hidden treasure. A quick 5 minutes later, they all gathered again to discover what prizes their eggs contained. Exclamations rang out as people opened eggs with money in them, and one neighbor said that in her 24 years in the neighborhood, no one had ever done something so fun. Many people asked if it would become an annual event, and offered to help plan next year's hunt. It was an amazing night of childlike wonder that brought the community together and brought great joy to me, the host. Grateful to God!"

    "Story": "A resident in our area informed us that his insurance would not cover the medical device that he needed.  My husband and I felt called to purchase for him, but wanted to do so anonymously.  I went to the provider to pay for his, then was compelled to cover expenses for others in need who might be in the same situation, but not known to us.  I would need the help of the manager in order to accomplish this.  I asked for the favor of her hand in determining who might have future needs that we could help with.  I was pleased when she agreed to the plan.  Knowing she was also a Christian, I asked her to take it one step further and pass out a grace bomb card each time the funds were used to help someone else.  She not only agreed to that as well, but created a \"Grace Bomb Account\" in which to deposit the sum of money dedicated for this purpose.  I left a check and a stack of cards and felt good knowing they would be put to good use in carrying out the healing ministry of Jesus."

    "Story": "Yesterday was Grace Bomb day, so this is to share my most recent Grace Bomb.  I was on vacation with my mom and sisters and we went to this Mexican Restaurant for dinner.  One of my sisters mentioned that there was a table of police officers near us and so I looked over and saw three officers from the Broward County Sheriff's office enjoying dinner.  Immediately I felt led to surprise them and take care of their check and the respective tip.  So I informed our server and made it happen.  I went over to their table and said \"excuse me for interrupting, I just want to say, \"consider yourselves Grace-bombed, your check and tip have been taken care of\", and thank you for your service.  (I didn't have any GB cards with me as I was on vacation).  Anyway, they were shocked and hopefully blessed by the act of kindness done in Jesus' name.  This also impacted our server as well as their server, so these acts of kindness - these Grace Bombs are far-reaching and it feels so good to be the giver.  Happy GB Day!  Matt. 5:16"

    "Story": "It seems I am motivated to drop Grace Bombs while on vacation.  It's a time to stop working and enjoy life, and realize the blessings that I have been afforded by our Lord Jesus.  So, this one was fun and different for me.  Last November, we were out listening to live music at a venue in Boca Raton.  I happened to find $140 on the floor and was in shock (two $20's and one $100 bill).  I held on to it and no one came to claim it by the end of the night as I wanted to return it if possible.  Anyway, I left there with this money and decided it needed to be distributed as Grace Bombs to bless others.  So I had breakfast out at Sylvain's and in addition to the normal tip, I handed our server a GB card and the $100 and hugged her and said, you have been Grace-Bombed, enjoy!  She was blown away and overcome with joy.  She said she had people coming to visit and this would help defray expenses.  As for the remaining $40, I ended up giving that to my sister's cleaning lady (complete stranger to me) and wrote her a nice uplifting card to go along with the GB card.  My family got to see Grace Bombs in action and it was so fun and a joy for me to be in this position to give.  The money wasn't mine to begin with and the Lord prompted me to impact others with it.  #gracebomb  #Matt.5:16  #bethelight"

I felt nudged by the Spirit to do just that. It wasn't a lengthy encounter but when I pulled up the window I paid for my order and then explained to the girl who was working the cash register that because of what God has already done for me through Jesus that, at the nudging of the Spirit, I felt led to bless her. I handed her a Grace Bomb card and some cash. She couldn't believe that someone would do something like that. I told her that it was from God, He was just using me to deliver it to her... and to close the conversation I said, \"You are loved!\" And then I pulled forward. I have no idea how God is using that, but it certainly made my day! Thank you Lord for allowing me to be a part of the way you are blessing others in our community!"

Right before i moved into my new apartment, i lived next to a gas station. One late night, we were having a really hard down pour of a thunderstorm. My kitchen window overlooks the gas station and i heard people yelling so i just sat there for a while watching. These 3 teenagers pulled into the parking lot cause their sun roof had collapsed on them while driving. Shattered glass all over them and the inside of the car, soaked interior from the rain and they were also soaked. The driver was so upset about getting in trouble with his parents for what happend to the car, they were hours away from home, and AAA wouldnt come to help them. I heard them on their phones trying to ask friends to come and help but nobody would and the staff of the gas station said they couldnt do anything for them. So i grabbed some towels, garbage bags, and my dust buster. I came down and told them im here to help. We tied the garbage bags together and made a temporary sun roof for the car, i vacuumed most of the glass from the car seats but there were still some small pieces, so we folded the towels and layed them on the seats so they can sit in the car. They were partially hesitant, surprised, grateful and probably creeped out that a random person came out in her pj's with a dust buster lol but i gave them a Restored church card, hugs, and they were able to drive back home."

I then went to the dollar store and bought 30 items for her since she was turning 30. I wrapped them each individually to make up for every birthday she didnt get to open something. I put them in a basket and tied some balloons to it and surprised her at work, by pranking her and making her think there was an emergency in the one office. She came running in to help and i came out of the office singing happy birthday along with another coworker of mine, carrying her gift out to her.

One person in our congregation was concerned about a local gas stations business near the church being low on business and we should support them. So I thought maybe I should work out an arrangement to give everyone in church a free gas card for one gallon since everyone talks about rising fuel cost. When I went to the store I discovered it was a new owner and he was thrilled I wanted to help with the idea. After the service everyone got a envelop with a coupon for gas and gracebomb cards. One gentleman on the way out of church said he liked he idea so much he was going to consider giving away gas to other people. So it felt like the grace bomb had some fuel behind it on kick off day that the Lord was already at work. I‚Äôm very excited to see what stories God will generate from this kicked off message. It felt so good to have 59 gallons of fuel to just give away today."

This morning we were running errands and my 7 year old said, \"Grace Bomb!\" then he kind of laughed and said, \"Why did I say that?\"\nWe were in an area that we never drive through and had to stop for fuel.  On the way to the gas station we passed a company called \"Buff City Soap\" and it jumped out at me bc that morning I had been sorting things under the sink in the bathroom and found an old bar of soap from Buff City that we had been gifted!  I had set it out on the counter.  I thought it was so interesting that we passed that business for the first time on the day that I had dug that out of the cupboard and set it out.  \n\nI said maybe we should go in there and my daughter said that she had noticed the soap that morning!  Then we remembered my son saying, \"Grace Bomb\" a few seconds ago and I said, \"Let's try to grace bomb them!  What do we have to give?\"  We had a gift bag in the car and a package of unopened cookies as well as a little card with a Scripture on it!  We put it all together and took it into the store- there were four young girls working and no one else in the store.  They seemed very happy to see us and we told them that we wanted to thank them for gifting their soap to a father/daughter dance and that we do this thing called, \"Grace Bomb\" and we wanted to bless them back and say thank you.  We gave them the gift and they were so thankful!  Then one of the girls gave us a tour of the store- my kiddos wanted to tip them some money but they weren't allowed to take tips so we just ended up buying something from the store and told them on the way out that we would pray they get lots of business.  \n\nOn the way home my daughter prayed that people would come to their store \"from all over the world\".  Amen.  It was so much fun!  We really felt like God's Spirit was leading us.  It was awesome to see how he had used each one of us to bring it together, even my littlest one who just smelling all of the soaps with us all."

My wife Nicola sat down with me for a late lunch, and surprised me by hitting me with a wonderful basket with the Grace Bomb attached to it. It was absolutely beautiful and had gifts for the house, myself and a copy of Grace Bomb itself in it! Headed to the website and saw the video. How beautiful and wonderful we are going to read the book together now on Wednesday's. Thank you for making such a wonderful concept and idea, and for helping people all over feel loved. Can't wait to start dropping my own bombs!"

My husband and I were wondering what was up.¬†\n\nThe night before we were to leave we are looking at this pile of firewood. We both came up with the idea of just putting a sign out ‚Äòfree firewood‚Äô.¬†\n\nIn moments a dad came by with his young son. He asked if the wood was really free. We told him how we got the firewood and yes, we were giving it away. So I said, if you boys will load the golf cart here, I‚Äôll deliver it to your site. So they loaded just what they needed.¬†\nAt the campsite the dad said it was their last night there and their firewood had gotten saturated by the rain & he wanted to have one last campfire with the boys.¬†\nHe kept saying I was so kind and he wanted to offer me money.¬†\nI told him what I had freely received I wanted to freely give. He just was having a hard time believing it.¬†\n\nWhen I returned to our site my husband said another couple came and couldn‚Äôt believe we‚Äôd give away firewood for free. They loaded their cart and took the rest. He said they were so grateful.¬†\n\n*This was just one of the ways that I learned that week that when the Lord has a plan on how I can be a blessing, He will provide the means to make it happen.¬†\nI had been asking the Lord what could I possibly have to give.¬†"

The culture team is a small group but I am typically the ring leader in charge of pushing things forward and I like to make sure things are taken care of so everything is fun and runs smoothly. In order to secure a picnic shelter for the event, I arrived at the park pretty early because they are first come, first serve. When I arrived, I called into a quick work meeting and afterward, I began making multiple trips from my car to the shelter to bring all the supplies. I felt like I made 10 trips with arms full when after getting to my car for one of the last trips, I saw something on my windshield. Once I looked closely, I realized it was a Grace Bomb - which I had never heard of - with a sweet note and a Starbuck's gift card. Man oh man did this make my whole day! It wasn't even about the gift itself, but it felt like the timing was just right. And when I looked into it more, it made it even better. I am a big believer of paying it forward and I always teach my kids about random acts of kindness and how small things can really make such a huge impact in someone's life. But I had never thought about tying the act to Jesus - it is such a wonderful and easy way of sharing your beliefs with others. I already ordered my grace bomb cards and I am excited to put them to good use in my community."

    "Story": "A guy in his late 60‚Äôs goes by our house twice a day on his bike. One day he stopped and chatted. This turned out to be me sharing about Christ, he is a believer. A few weeks later he stopped and told me his son who was 49 passed away. I listened to him talk and before he left asked if I could pray with him.\n\nEveryday Wayne and I pray that God would use us to be a blessing to someone that day. Fast forward to vacation at Acadia National Park. I see a car with a plate that has a Syracuse dealership, so I ask the couple if they live in Syracuse and they said no thirty minutes south. The woman lives in Homer. She was on a quick vacation with her boyfriend. We all chatted and I finally said to the guy, you‚Äôve been together for two years and you are in Maine, this is the perfect spot to pop the question on top of this mountain. He said yes, the ring is in my boot and we all laughed. Finally, he said he needed to use the restroom, Wayne and I were eating supper on the rocks when the couple came back and he said, she said yes, we are now engaged and the ring was literally in my boot. So I told them I was a photographer and they had to let me do their engagement shoot on top of that mountain.  At the end the guy tried handing me a $100 bill, I told him about praying to be a blessing to someone and they were it. We talked some more and it was getting dark, and we were getting ready to say bye when I asked them if they would take offense if I prayed with them. I did and now there is a wonderful friendship forming.\n\nNext day Grace Bomb the cleaning lady at the hotel and another day the ladies that prepared breakfast.\n\nOne of the days we decided to go to another part of Acadia and on the way I say buoys and lobster traps which I thought was a great photo op. The man was out working on his traps and I asked him if it would be okay to take pictures. From there it turned out to be almost three hours of speaking with him and eventually his wife. He was 51 but looked like he was in mid sixties. He shared about his life (because I kept asking him questions about his story). His wife had a lover that he didn‚Äôt know about. This guy came and shot him in the head which went right through his eye. He wasn‚Äôt expected to live. The wife told the authorities he had tried to commit suicide. He became addicted to the pain meds and an alcoholic. He spent a year in prison for burning a lobster boat down. He was allowed out one hour a day. One night he got on his knees and gave his life to Christ. However, he still struggles with forgiving himself. His first wife turned his two sons against him and he has had no communication since 2001, I asked if I could pray with him, which I did and he was a bucket of tears. His wife came home and she has Lupus really bad so I ended up praying with her. Talk about how God gives us opportunities if we take the time to look for them. \n\nI had tape on my knees and people kept asking me what I did. I told them that the tape allowed me to be able to bike and hike without any pain but always ended it by saying that God is good and by his grace I was able to do what I was doing. I can‚Äôt even begin to count how many people I told this too.\n\nComing home we stopped by a friend‚Äôs house as they were leaving on vacation the next day for three weeks. They both grew up in the church but are not believers. When we were getting ready to leave, I asked if they would be offended if I prayed with them and they both were okay with it.\n\nYou did the sermon about the letter you wrote to your son. Tonight I sent my youth group girls along with a couple of the guys the following letter.\nWanted to let you know that I am praying for you as you head back to school tomorrow. My prayer is that you will continue to seek God in everything you do. There are so many choices that you are bombarded with. Always ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this something that I would want Jesus to see me doing?‚Äù You experienced summer camp and felt the presence of God, you left on a spiritual high but then you came back to a place where you mixed with unbelievers. \n\nYou want to fit in but sometimes that means things you don‚Äôt really want to do, but do it anyways. Being a believer is hard, you may experience persecution, in this world we will face trials and troubles, but God will always be with us and help us to overcome. May you be light in the darkness. May others see you are different and want to know why, be bold and share the gospel, tell them about Jesus. This world needs more Jesus in the midst of chaos. I know that you might be thinking, ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt know what I am going through.‚Äù I may not have gone though something that you are facing, but believe me I have been through times, that it is only by faith that I have overcome. The bad times have made me stronger. \n\nTake these verses and commit to memory, these will be encouragement for you:\n‚ÄúBe strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.‚Äù  Joshua 1:9 NLT\n\n‚ÄúDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.‚Äù Philippians 4:6-7 ESV\n\nRemember that I am always here for you. I care about you and want you to be the best that you can be.\n\nDan, thank you for the impact you have had on my life. Never would I have ever imagined praying on the spot for people. This was way out of my comfort zone but as time goes on, it is becoming easier. So many hurting people needing to hear the gospel. Thank you for equipping me to share it.\nCindy"

So while she was retrieving the drink I grabbed a Grace Bomb card and paired it with a gift card to Chick fil A. When she came back to the window, in a grumpy manner she handed me the limeade, I paid her and then I called her by name, told her I was a pastor from a nearby church and that I wanted to give her \"this\", the card and gift card and to let her know that she is loved.\nIt was like someone flipped a switch on whatever control there is for her face and she just lit up! One of the teenagers in our youth group works at the same Sonic and he told me that he saw her holding the card and when he wanted to talk to her about it she wasn't interested.

Visits from them became the best... most looked forward to ...Ôøºpart of her day ...I was witness to that till the end. \n\nWith their Brownie Bag, theyÔøº'll present it to someone...\nThen hopefully share their story of presenting the Brownie Grace BombÔøº in Mom's memory. \nHere:\nhttps://www.gracebomb.org/\n\nKeeping Mom's memory alive ... planting the 'brownie' seeds of God's love and grace everywhere in her memory.Ôøº"

My family is very religious and I went to catholic school, when I tell my mom about my anxiety‚Äôs she will always tell me to just put it in Gods hands or to trust in God. This has always frustrated me because I never found it that easy and still find myself questioning God sometimes. A couple nights ago I was awake all night not being able to fall asleep, thinking back to what my mom said, I asked God for a sign. If I really should just give my anxieties and worries to Him. I brushed it off the next day as nothing happened and went on about my day, still constantly anxious. \n\nToday, I was in the drive through line for Starbucks, getting coffee before heading to the library to work on a group project. My total came to be about 20$ and when I got to the window the worker handed me the ‚ÄúGrace Bomb‚Äù card and told me the woman in front had paid for my order. At first I thought Grace was for her name, I didn‚Äôt connect that it was Catholic meaning at all. I asked the worker if this was a ‚Äúpay it forward chain‚Äù where everyone has been paying for each other‚Äôs orders and he told me no, but the women felt like I needed that card. Then, super confused, I took a closer look and found this website. I felt so shaken as I had received my sign I had asked for. This was cold hard evidence to me that this was a sign to let God take care of my anxieties for me. I have never experienced something like this before and I am in utter shock at this experience. I feel so loved and relaxed, fully allowing myself to give my anxieties to God the best I can."

    "Story": "I was Grace Bombed by Pat early in his development of this initiative. My husband Paul and I attended Bay Area Church while he was a teaching Pastor there. This was about 12 years ago.\nI loved his messages largely due to his visuals. Paul and I are both visual learners, so revealing Gods word in that manner, was so helpful in our walk with Jesus! \nI just ordered your cards, because I ‚Äúhappened‚Äù  across the You Tube session when Pat was on Focus on the Family. I was looking for something to watch, and there was this familiar face on the suggested videos. I felt like I was back in church with Pat teaching his Grace Bomb message! What a great reminder of his concept. \nGod is working in my heart, mind and body to reveal the true person He created me to be. He is opening my eyes to the lies I have believed for more than 50 years. I have been a believer for about 35 years, but Satan has ‚Äúbombarded‚Äù me with many lies, that I believed. NO MORE! \nThank you Pat for your part in my journey with God.\nMay our Holy God continue to bless you and your family as you seek to serve him as a man after His heart.\nYour sister in Christ, Carla Rouse."

I declined initially as we are not allowed to take \"tips.\" She stated \"this is not what you think it is,\" So I questioned one more time before accepting it. When I opened it and looked at the paper, I immediately got chills. GRACE - in big bold letters. My friend and I have been discussing grace heavily in the recent weeks. In fact, almost every Sunday for the past few weeks our pastor has been preaching about grace. I'm still getting chills as I type this. \nThe patient allowed me to give her a hug and express the heavy discussions and lessons on grace that I have been experiencing. God knows exactly what we need and His timing is perfect. \nI'm thankful that God sent this complete stranger to me today. \n\nGraceBomb is a beautiful this and I will definitely share."

I felt that tug again - the same one that had kept her on my mind this whole time.  I took money I had brought for souvenirs and tucked it and a grace Bomb card into a pair of shoes she has collected from the clothing.  I looked at her and said ‚Äúfor school‚Äù.

(Which I chose because I was trying to avoid having to have a conversation with people.) In the car line there was a car that wasn't moving forcing the people in line to drive around them. I could sense the tension this was causing me to be impatient (at the least) with this person. As I drove around them to move forward in the line I noticed they were on the phone which seemed strange.  Oh well I thought I'll just go around them and get about my day.  God had other plans. As I was communicating my order I feel my car get struck from behind.  The gal that was on the phone just drove into the back of my car.  No there are moments when Christ works through you and this was one of them.  As I got out of my car to see the damage and communicate with the gal the Holy Spirit was clearly reminding me to be patient and listen.  It turns out the girl had something stuck under her brake that prevented her from stopping. She was apologizing and crying. I suggested we pull out of the drive thru lane and check everything out.  Turns out there was no damage to the cars (God's grace bomb) but unbelievably this gal shares with me that her mom had just died that night and that her world was crumbling around her.  Talk about a moment of realizing how it important it is to not judge circumstances by just your eyes.  I listened to her story and then was prompted to offer to walk inside and buy her breakfast.  She couldn't believe it.  She hit me and I was offering to buy the food.  \nAnyways her comment to me as we parted ways was humbling.  She said \"I jusst can't believe that you are being so kind everyone else would have cursed her out or maybe worse.\"  \nThe church were I pastor is in sight of the restaurant and I told her that if there is anything we could do to help her during this difficult time to contact that church.  \nI didn't have any grace bomb cards on me although this would have been a perfect time to share one.  I walked away thankful for the encouragement to think and act as a grace built person that I had been processing due to this material.  I pray that God's grace would be unleashed in this gals life for God's glory."

I couldn‚Äôt wait to share the news with my daughters who attended this message at our church and got their own grace bomb cards. I texted them as soon as I got home. Such a great feeling!!!\nThank you"

I‚Äôve never met such animosity and abrasive behavior before. This person really made me want to make the Jesus in me leave for a minute.  \n\nOn my drive home, I prayed over this teacher (and myself). I then decided that I was going to Grace Bomb this person the next day. \n\nToday, I nervously went up to this person and directly handed them a card (slightly fearful of being attacked again). I told them that being a new teacher‚Äîheck, being a teacher‚Äîis tough. We all need a good reminder to give ourselves grace, that we‚Äôre bestowed with grace, and that we need to extend grace to others. Sometimes, we forget what it‚Äôs like to be overwhelmed. Sometimes, we forget to think about others as just being messengers delegated to share messages/tasks. Sometimes, we just need someone to say ‚ÄúI see you. I hear you. I get you.‚Äù"

I stepped away from formally attending church and thought I could walk alone with the Lord. I fell into years of anxiety and depression until the Lord said, ‚ÄúGo to Lighthouse‚Äù. I attended with a friend and thought - I‚Äôll give it another shot next week solo. The night before I cried myself to sleep and begged God for a real friend. The next day Jesus saved me at Light house through his dutiful daughter, Emily. Emily courageously tapped me on the shoulder, as I was weeping, and said hi I‚Äôm Emily! And I heard the Lord say, I will give you rest. The rest I was searching for was Jesus calling me back home. I am a changed woman because Jesus restored my light. Walking out of church today, I gave 2 grace bombs to the service man and woman watching over our beautiful Church.

    "Story": "Hey Pat, I dropped my first grace bomb last Saturday in front of Tractor Supply Company in Glen Burnie.  Before I arrived at the the store I thought perhaps there might be a table set up out front like I‚Äôve occasionally seen in the past. Often times it‚Äôs a faith-based organization of sorts. Hat‚Äôs off to TSC for providing the venue for such efforts. When leaving the store, as planned I made eye contact with the gentleman sitting at the table and I asked him what he had going on. He replied that he was selling T-shirts and collecting donations to support homeless veterans. Figuring to tee up a conversation about Jesus, I asked the guy why he was doing this. Well, it didn‚Äôt go quite how I expected. He said this was part of a program he‚Äôs in where he does this 4 days per week. Feeling a little flat footed, I told him that was great‚Ä¶that I‚Äôd like to give him a donation‚Ä¶and then slipped him a 20 wrapped around a grace bomb card. The guy politely thanked me and dutifully put the 20 (grace bomb card and all) in his small cash box. I was pretty convinced he didn‚Äôt even see the card but I quietly hoped he‚Äôd find it later. Just as I got to my car, a text from Light House Church hit my phone with a survey. I began to drive away but then felt prompted to pull back into a parking spot and check it out. As I filled out the survey, one question was for topics I‚Äôd like to hear more about in the Sunday sermons. I racked my brain a minute because LH sermons are so rock solid, I didn‚Äôt immediately have anything to offer. Then I began my reply with, ‚ÄúWell since you asked, perhaps some practical tips on how I can walk out my faith in every day life.‚Äù And as I typed I was reminded‚Ä¶hey wait a second, this Grace Bomb series is doing just that.  And it was at that moment the Holy Spirit prompted me to amp up the grace bomb I had just dropped. I looked across the parking lot and saw a Burger King. Then I looked back at the table in front of TSC and noticed the gentleman I‚Äôd just left was now accompanied by his colleague that had temporarily stepped away. I knew what I needed to do. I drove the 100 yards to the BK, bought 2 plain cheeseburgers, 2 large fries, a coke and a Sprite and included some salt, pepper, ketchup packs, napkins and straws for good measure. Then I drove back to the table in front of the TSC and said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHey, I just thought you guys might be hungry.  I spent 22 years on active duty and I really appreciate what you‚Äôre doing representing and caring for our vets. But more importantly, I want to thank you for representing Jesus Christ.‚Äù\n\nMy gesture was well received with smiles and ‚ÄúGod bless you‚Äôs.‚Äù As I drove away, I thanked God for the opportunity to be obedient and for the resulting joy in my heart that I was so blessed to experience. Thanks Pat for giving me the encouragement I needed to live out God‚Äôs instruction to love my neighbor and be the light of the world."

The next day he had a gift of a card, mug with a stuffie and it read ‚Äú Thank you for saving my life‚Äù in his little 1st grade writing. I was able to share with him that I truly believe Jesus was watching over us both! And his response was ‚Äúyes‚Äù. I literally felt I did not have control of that situation as I have never been trained for that. But God did!! I reflect on it often and I felt the Holy Spirit take total control"

    "Story": "Hey Pat, it‚Äôs me again.  After finishing chapter 2 of Grace Bomb, I brainstormed some grace bomb ideas. This sunk in for a day or two and on Friday I had taken the day off work and decided to act. My target would be the family next door‚Ä¶specifically 3-year-old Joshua. My wife and I are acquaintances with the couple next door, but much less so with their adult daughter and young grandson who live with them.  Joshua is so cute you just want to hug him like a teddy bear.  The relationship we currently have is with the couple that are the grandparents. But it‚Äôs largely one of waving as you drive by and the occasional chat at the mailbox or when outside walking the dog or raking leaves.\nOn this particular day, I drove to the nearby Dollar Tree store, grabbed a kid-friendly card and hit the toy aisle with the Holy Spirit leading the way. He led me to some silly putty, then play doh, then light stick-style glow bracelets, a mini etch-a-sketch and lastly‚Ä¶a bag of M&M‚Äôs. I never met a kid that didn‚Äôt smile when handed a bag of M&M‚Äôs. All this bootie totaled a whopping $7.50. Which just goes to show that grace bombing isn‚Äôt predicated on a huge outlay of cash. :-)\nI went home and wrote a note in Joshua‚Äôs card telling him how special he was and stuffed all the loot into an ‚ÄúIncredibles‚Äù goodie bag. Then I put this inside another bag with a note on top to the adults in Joshua‚Äôs family with a Grace Bomb card attached. In that note I simply let our neighbors know that my wife and I thought today would be a good day to make extra special for Joshua and that if they agreed, to pass the goodie bag on to him. Then I hung the bag on their door and turned the rest over to the Holy Spirit.\nThe next morning Joshua and his mother were at our door expressing their gratitude. While it was a surface-level conversation, it was the first one we‚Äôve ever had with Joshua‚Äôs mom. Her parting words were that she really liked the card. I‚Äôm inclined to think it was the grace bomb card she was speaking of. And the real bonus was that I got to give Joshua a big hug and compliment him on his totally awesome Spiderman slippers! Thanks Pat for nudging me to show Christ‚Äôs love to my neighbor!!! I‚Äôm confident this is not something I would‚Äôve ever dreamed up without the Holy Spirit working through you to get my attention to act on His behalf."

My prescription was sent to the wrong pharmacy. It was disheartening because I had to drive further away from home and all I wanted to do was get home, take my medicine and get in comfortable clothes. As I had to wait in the drive-thru, Meredith (Pharmacy Tech, I think) said she moved my prescription up to the front of the line and that it would take 15 minutes. She said I can wait in the drive-thru, but if a car pulls up, I will have to drive around again. Lo and behold, no car pulled behind me and my prescription was ready in 5 minutes. I was so grateful that I wrote a thank you note and gave Meredith and the Pharmacist a Chick-Fil-A gift card, along with a Grace Bomb card. I do not like to share what I have done, but like I said at the beginning, I feel like I was blessed first."

I felt the Holy Spirit prompt me but then I stopped listening and started asking \"What do I say? What if I freak her out? What if I end up being one of those weird Jesus people to her?\" By the time I shook those questions, it was my stop and I missed my shot.\n\nI was kicking myself for allowing my fears and insecurities to rob this mom of a loving compliment and encouragement. I took a deep breath and spoke under my breath: Jesus, I want to do better. You told my heart and I was too afraid. I want to trust you.\n\nMinutes after leaving the train station a woman asked me for directions, I told her I wasn't a local but maybe I could look it up on my phone. She explained that she was looking to buy a local transit pass because she was commuting to and through the city three days a week for work. It was cold and windy out and rather than send her on a wild goose chase downtown. I opened my wallet and pulled out two cards: my city pass and a gracebomb. I explained that I was visiting and that I wouldn't need the pass after today but unfortunately there was only 20¬¢ left on the card. I added that she could use it to reload at any transit location. I don't know if she'll use the card or if she thought I was a weird Jesus person when I said \"Have a blessed day!\" when we parted.\n\nI will repeat this over and over: there's someone waiting to be blessed by you because God wants them to know who He is. When the fear and anxiety of stepping out in faith trips you up, let our compassionate Saviour pick you up and set you back on the path ‚ù§Ô∏è"

    "Story": "My Grace Bomb story has several moving pieces working together to end up in a Grace Bomb with no known result. Like the Warren Zevon song this Grace Bomb includes ‚ÄúLawyers, Guns, and Money.‚Äù Well, more like lawyers, God, and money. Guns may be involved but I have no knowledge of that. Also, knowing that lawyers are involved, and ongoing litigations, names will not be used. \nThe story starts with my son allegedly doing something stupid. On this night I went to see him to discuss the situation. It is important to know that my son and I have a strained relationship. This was the first time ever that I ‚Äúvisited‚Äù him where he lives. We had a discussion. I expressed my concern, my disappointment, and my love. We talked about the need for a better, stronger relationship and a clearer vision for a more promising future. After about an hour I left my son with three requests. The last of these was to consider going to church with me and learning about what good Jesus could do in his life. He was excuse filled but not entirely against the idea.\nA few weeks later when preliminary court appearances started, my son asked that I be there. I had already planned to attend. This day‚Äôs events were not complicated and did not require a lawyer. However, I suggested that a lawyer will soon become useful. (There‚Äôs a whole lawyer joke in there somewhere.) My son explained that he knew of a lawyer he had heard was good and he would contact him. He did.\nOn the night of their first meeting, I went to the lawyers office to see how I could help. They had already started their meeting so I sat in the waiting area. Also in the waiting area that night was a couple, estranged at best, friendly nonetheless. I overheard the gentleman explain to his estranged wife that he needed new jeans, but they were $10 and he did not have $10. They continued to have a conversation that indicated that money was most definitely tight and at this point neither was sure how they were getting home. This is where I got involved. It doesn‚Äôt end how you think.\nI asked where they were headed. They were headed into the city to an area I didn‚Äôt think I wanted to visit. (Missed Bomb #1) In reality I was headed the opposite direction. Excuse I know, but I could still help. They started to discuss the use of an Uber but neither had any experience with this. I offered to help and asked for an address. Plugging the address into my Uber app I told them there was an Uber close and the cost would be $14. The gentleman struggled to download the Uber app to his phone and begin the process. He eventually got everything settled and his wife offered her credit card to pay the $14. I eventually had to help complete the transaction correctly ad they were set. As I completed the transaction I started to think that I could have probably used my app and card to schedule an Uber for their use. After a quick Google search I found that I was correct and it is quite simple to get an Uber for some other person. (Missed Bomb #2)\nMy son‚Äôs appointment had ended and we all left the building at the same time. I had a quick conversation with my son and he headed home. I caught up with the couple and explained that they must walk around to the front of the building because the Uber was expecting to pick them up there. I walked with them and showed them how they could use the app to track the Uber‚Äôs location. They were very thankful for my help as I turned to walk back to my car. About half way back to my car I felt a calling. Checking my pockets, I had $5 cash. I walked back to the couple and explained it was all I had but they could have it. They were reluctant to take it but were happy to have it. They expressed their thankfulness and offered God‚Äôs blessing. I offered the same. (Mini Bomb #3 not missed)\nAs I walked away, I wished I could have done more and over the next week started thinking about sending money to the gentlemen. I know his address because I had it in my Uber app. I know he was an Army veteran because we had that conversation. I also know his wife‚Äôs first name is Jacki because he disclosed this while trying to complete the Uber transaction with her credit card. \nFast forward a few days to Sunday 29 January and a sermon on gratitude. As part of this sermon Pastor asked 4 people to address the congregation, expressing their individual reasons for being grateful. To my surprise, the second person to take the stage was my son‚Äôs new attorney. I had no idea we attended the same church. After the service I had a brief conversation with him, expressing my concern for the lack of Jesus in my son‚Äôs life. \nNow we move ahead to the next Sunday and the beginning sermon of the Grace Bomb series. Having the continued thought of helping ‚ÄúJacki‚Äôs husband,‚Äù this Grace Bomb series spoke to me, loud and clear. Armed now with a new sense of purpose and, of course, a Grace Bomb card, I prepared a care package for this more or less stranger. Tuesday morning I put together a short letter, a Grace Bomb card, and $200 cash and sent it to ‚ÄúThe Army Veteran (Jacki‚Äôs Husband),‚Äù at the address I still had in my Uber app.\nI have no way of knowing the result of this Bomb but I pray the money got to the right person and had a positive impact on his life."

He was talking to a lady as she was walking in the door. I looked at him and turned my head down and looked away. I didn't want to be bothered. I went to the ladies room and God said that man needs a break. I had grace bomb cards and $35 dollars.  I talked with God.  Our money is so tight since I have been out of work. I have been filing my truck $35 dollars at a time cuz I can't afford to fill it.  But God said who are you trusting that man needs a break.  So when I came out of the bathroom prepared to give him the cash with a geace bomb card.  I didn't see him. I thought oh well at least I was willing (reluctantly) as I went to check out there he was. I was on the phone so I just walked up to him and put the money and the gracebomb card in his hand. The look on his face was amazed.  I was still on the phone so I smiled and pointed my finger at my eye then at him to let him know I see him.  I cashed out and left. I got in my truck and I forgot a fork for my chicken salad.  So I went back in and he was standing at the door with tears in his eyes.  He said you have no idea how perfect the timing was for this.  I said no I didn't but God did. I asked his name... it is Brent. I gave him a hug and told him that God knows and He has him. Keep moving forward.  Then I left.  I cried in the truck cause when I hugged him I could feel his gratitude and hope come back.  God is so faithful. Thank you for the holy spirit and promoting me when my plan was to just ignore one of God's children.  Whatever you do for the least of my brothers that you do into me."

After rustling through my purse and of course, I didn‚Äôt have my Grace Bomb cards .  I decided to do it anyway.  So after he gave me my boots, I said I want to do something nice for you today.  He asked what I meant.  I said I‚Äôd like to treat you to anything you want, like a cup of hot coffee, a cold drink or a lunch.  He said I would really like a bowl of soup.  I went next door to the Safeway but they didn‚Äôt have hot soup.  So I‚Äôm thinking where am I going to find hot soup.  I wasn‚Äôt near any fast food places.  Then I remembered an Italian place not too far away.  I swung in and found out they had soup, so I ordered an Italian soup with a tomato base with veggies and pasta,  I ordered and waited about 15 minutes for my order and bonus, it came with a piece of garlic bread.  I rushed back to his shop with my paper bag in hand and he lit up.  He was so excited and I was just as excited.  He thanked me profusely and said God Bless you.  I thanked him back for letting me do this for him.  We both were flying high.  He was as much a blessing to me as I was for him.  I will never forget that feeling and it lasted all day.  Thank you, Mr. Coleman"

They would be home that afternoon.  So, I threw together a lasagna and a couple tossed salads to put in their fridge and met one of my sisters at their house to do a quick dust and vacuum through for them.  Although I thought about the Grace Bomb card I didn't think this would qualify since it was something I would have done anyway.  But then I remembered the card was to point not to my act but to the kindness  of Jesus.  So I left it on their coffee table on the way out.  I haven't heard from them, but that's okay,  They have their hands full with a beautiful baby girl."

When I returned from the walk, there were 2 teenage girls sitting on the bench swing we have in a side part of our yard which is on a creek. Their backs were to me, & my first reaction was wondering why they would be in someone's yard that they didn't even know. (Apparently, I'd already forgotten the earlier prayer.) That thought, however, was immediately replaced with a gentle reminder that it's Grace Bomb day and that I should go give them popsicles. I went inside without them noticing me, got 2 popsicles, & went back outside where I talked to them for a few minutes, learned their names, & gave them the popsicles. They were so shocked & said they thought I was going to tell them to \"get out.\" Maybe a simple popsicle will pave the way for more conversations with them...Definitely a Grace Bomb opportunity straight from God!"

    "Story": "I was shopping at Walmart one Friday, grabbing last-minute items for a party I was throwing the next day. I had a list to stick to but I was in a hurry, running through all of the different departments trying to get just what I needed. I made my way to the checkout line and was rushing through checking myself out. I saw a mother and her two kids that I was sort of familiar with at the end of my aisle. I didn‚Äôt make eye contact and didn‚Äôt say hi. I was in too much of a hurry. I got out to my vehicle and was unloading my purchases when I noticed I forgot celery. All of the sudden, I got a strange urge to pay for that family‚Äôs groceries. I hesitated for a second because it felt crazy! I stopped and prayed ‚ÄúGod, if you want this to happen you better make the timing right.‚Äù At that point, I knew I still had to unload the rest of my groceries and run over to the produce section to grab the celery, all in perfect timing for her to be cashing out. I also knew I had to dig my grace bomb card out of my car, as well. I did what I had to do in the parking lot, and went back into the store. I got my celery and headed for the register. I am not the type of person to get nervous, but walking up to the register I was feeling all sorts of emotions, it felt like there was electricity running through my veins! Sure enough, I made it back just when it looked like she was finishing up. I started walking toward her cart in line and was just about there when I almost slipped and fell, raising my arms in the air-showing her the celery in my hand. I looked down to see what I had slipped on and it was a pile of sugar, I immediately asked if she had spilled sugar, just to acknowledge my fall. We sort of laughed that off and I then asked if she had swiped her last item through the register, and she said yes. Right then, I realized my celery was still in the air from my awkward slip! She looked at it and told me to ‚Äúgo ahead and put my celery through.‚Äù I smiled and told her that it was nice of her to offer but tonight I was paying for her groceries instead. Right away she told me no, but I went ahead with the payment. She asked me why, and I gave her the card that was up my sleeve. I told her to check it out. She asked me if she could hug me and told me that she and the kids were on their way to Cleveland Clinic to see their husband and father who was in the ICU fighting cancer. I told her I knew a little bit about his diagnosis and I was glad to have been able to help. Inside, I knew it wasn‚Äôt me. I had yet to do anything for this family, and I am ashamed to say I don‚Äôt know if I ever would have. I didn‚Äôt have any time for them that night‚Ä¶ \nI know now that she went to the website that was suggested on the card. I also know that God worked through me and used me for his glory. Sometimes for me, especially lately, I wonder if I am making a difference for Him. I am thankful for our God, and His reminder that I am His servant and I am doing His work, and it feels so perfectüòä"

I tried to find its owner by knocking on all of the connecting units of my complex to the sidewalk I found it on. I held on to it for a few weeks just to see if somebody would claim it after letting all my neighbors know where they could find it if anybody asked. After several weeks I decided it was \"found\" money and had to figure out what to do with it when I felt the Lord speaking to me about using it as a grace bomb for someone. I thought about who would be good to receive it and I felt the Lord wanted me to just hold on to it letting me know that He would decide when where and who would receive it. Last week my car had to go to the dealership because of two recall notices. A young girl who worked for the dealership drove me to work and told me she would be picking me up later when my car was ready. She was so sweet and in our conversations I found out that she hadn't been working there very long and had not had a paycheck yet. When she picked me up later in the afternoon I felt the tug of the Holy Spirit saying she was the Grace bomb girl. I asked her if she felt like God saw her. She said she didn't know. I briefly spoke to her about how God sees us and knows when we have a need. To make a long story short I gave her the $20 bill with a Grace bomb card and told her that God laid her on my heart to receive it and to please scan and listen to the Grace bomb message and she promised that she would. She was very grateful to have some money in her pocket and I know that the Lord will multiply the message in her heart."

Before I walked in I noticed two kids who played basketball with my son years ago ‚Äì we‚Äôll call them John and Sean. Sean was carrying a small leather book that appeared to be a bible. It was early and high school didn‚Äôt start for another 90 minutes or so. As I sat and waited for my group their group grew to 4, with one man a little older than the teens. I suspected he was a Young Life leader. I had seen these kids on social media related to local YL events. I was so encouraged to see a younger group of believers meeting and learning about God and life together. \n\nI felt the intense urge to pay for these teens breakfast and drop a bomb. Initially, I wanted to grab a gift card and just give it to the kids ‚Äì but they weren‚Äôt accepting gift cards for some reason. So I had to talk to their waitress. I asked her to bring me their check once she had it, she didn‚Äôt seem thrilled that I was going to pay for it ‚Äì I bet she thought I‚Äôd stiff her on a tip. Anyway, I ended up paying for the boys and also leaving a tip for the waitress. She came back over and I gave her a GB Card to give to the boys, but then also one for herself. \n\nI could hear the boys astonishment when she told them someone paid for their bill ‚Äúno way‚Äù, ‚Äúso cool‚Äù ‚Äì but there were two better moments than that‚Ä¶ \n(1) As they were walking away it seemed they were unsure what to do with the card, the leader told them to take it and we‚Äôll give it out to someone next time we‚Äôre together!! YES, that‚Äôs the whole reason for the movement I thought. But then the waitress came back over, apparently, the boys had tipped her as well and she was visibly overcome with the generosity laid upon her on this early Friday morning. \n\nNow to reload my wallet!"

We talked for close to 30 minutes about our pasts in ministry and I was very impressed with his story. While I was originally planning to tip $5, after talking long enough about the faith and the conference I upped my tip to $20. Not only for the conversation we had but for his general outlook on life. He was so positive that I wanted to leave a grace bomb."

    "Story": "Over the years I have volunteered at the Exponential Church planting conference down in Orlando Florida I have come across my fair share of crazy stories, but out of all of them I'm sure this is the coolest!\n\nOther people in my volunteer group went out to eat which I missed because I took a nap after a long day of volunteer work. I wanted to get out of my hotel room after the conference ended and enjoy the warm weather I wish I could have back home. But as I left my room I realized I left my room key inside of my room. I had no other way of getting back inside so I decided to go for a stroll as I knew I'd likely be locked out for the next 2 hours.\n\nWhen I was walking down the sidewalk near my hotel I came across a homeless man, he asked me if I had any kind of spare change that could help him afford a meal. He seemed like a very friendly person with good intentions so instead ignoring him or running away I decided to ask him if he knew Jesus. \n\nThis man used to be a church goer but he stopped going because he felt God no longer desired a relationship with him after he fell into a drug addiction. He pursued his addiction so much that not only did he run out of money, he also burnt bridges with family and the other people he loved the most. I was heartbroken to hear his story and asked him if I could pray over him, he was reluctant at first but he eventually caved in and allowed me to pray for him. I spent the next 5 minutes talking to God over this man I had never met hoping the lord would connect with him and help him find some peace. After that I gave him $15 and a grace bomb card, I reminded him that the lord would never deny him and that if he believed in Christ he would be forgiven. \n\nI left him with my favorie verse Ephesians 2:10\n\n‚ÄúFor we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.‚Äù\n\nJust as a way of saying \"God created you to do great things. Never forget that\" and then I continued on my way."
